    Split a rule document into chunks ready for embedding.

    This function is already implemented — read through it and the inline
    comments before moving on. The decisions made here directly shape what
    retrieval returns in Milestones 2 and 3, so it's worth understanding
    before you build on top of it.

    Strategy: character-based sliding window with overlap.
      - chunk_size = 300 characters: long enough to carry the semantic
        meaning of a single rule, short enough to return targeted results
      - overlap = 50 characters: duplicates a small window of text at each
        boundary so a rule that spans two chunks can still be retrieved intact
      - min_length = 50 characters: filters out whitespace artifacts and
        very short fragments that add noise without useful semantic content

    Returns a list of dicts, each with:
      - "text"     : the chunk text (str)
      - "game"     : the game name, e.g. "Catan" (str)
      - "chunk_id" : a unique identifier, e.g. "catan_0", "catan_1" (str)
